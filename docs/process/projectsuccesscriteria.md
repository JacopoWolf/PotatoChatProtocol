<h1>Project Success Criteria</h1>
</center>

### The PCP (**P**otato**C**hat**P**rotocol) Project will be considered a success if:
* **A basic version test system is delivered on (or before) December 13th 2019.**
 
  Version 1.0 must be published by the specified date. To consider the version 1.0 completed, it must allow users to use all the basic functions of the server through a client application. 

  These main funtions are:
  * login and disconnection
  * exchange of private and public messages
  * change of alias
  
  Furthermore errors and exceptions must be handled appropriately.


* **Concerns raised during the test period are addressed according to the problem resolution plan contained in the Software Project Management Plan.**

  All major bugs related to basic functions will need to be fixed by the end of the trial period.

  Each problem encountered will be documented through the use of Github, a VCS software. The bugs will be solved in order of time according to their weight which will be established by the development team.
  The project documentation will contain all the information about the discovered and solved bugs.

  Users shall be notified of their rights and responsibilities under this policy prior to the start of acceptance test.


* **Community can easily use the protocol to develop a client application.**

  This specifically means that every developer who wants to implement a chat application based on this protocol must have the possibility to do it quickly and easily thorugh the study of the related documentation.

  Furtheremore the server that is already implemented must be easy to configure and start.


* **The system is properly documented**

  First, a user manual shall be produced and included. This user manual must present how to initialize a new PCP server which allows the exchange of messages between several connected user. The server configuration must be explained in order to be clear.

  Second, a system manual shall be produced. This system manual shall consist of the architecture document, as well as any additional material required to provide a technician with all necessary information needed to maintain and update the system. A single read through of this document and no more than 2 hours looking at the code should provide an appropriately skilled technician with all the information necessary to understand the system.

* **Known defects are entered into the Github issues tracking system.**

  After December 13th defects that are found but not fixed immediately will be entered into the Github issues tracking system.
