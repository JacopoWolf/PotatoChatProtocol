## Scope

### For who

PCP and its official implementation are aimed at small groups who need a completely local, controlled and simple way to chat with others in the same network.

### What

#### The protocol
- **open source**: everyone can contribute with new useful ideas 
- **extremely simple**: meaning low resources needed for parsing and easy custom implementations
- **local**: nothing goes through a server located who-knows-where, data is controlled in your network.

#### The server
- **open source**: bugs and flaws will have a short life
- **simple usage**: the server is extremely simple to boot up and in very short time, without the need to learn complicated interfaces and confusing configuration files.
- **optimized**: requires low resources on the host machine
- **expandable**: want to implement a custom version of the protocol? Documented and easy to use interfaces for every component are given!

### Why

because it's an extremely easy, portable and expandable protocol, perfectly good for small realities who need a way to talk between rooms withouth yelling and withouth losing control of their messages.
