* `dev-{M version}` is for major versions. Those are tagged for releases. Protected.
* `plan-{M version}-{scope}` are for planning and designing base classes.
* `feature-{M version}-{feature name}` are for developing a feature for the dev-* branch. Can contain documentation.
* `docs-{M version}` are for writing **only** additional documentation.
  
names like `USERNAME-master-feature1` are **NOT** accepted.
